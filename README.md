# AIRBNB ANALYSIS

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
    This project involves analyzing Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas. The objective is to clean and prepare the data, create interactive geospatial visualizations, and develop dynamic plots to reveal pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. The challenge is integrating MongoDB Atlas with Python for seamless data analysis and visualization, culminating in an interactive Streamlit web application for user-friendly exploration.
